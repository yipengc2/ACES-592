Question 1
We have used the "foreach" library to perform parallelization in this excerise, are there any other libraries that can do the same thing? List at least 3 other different parallelization libraries.

Answer:
parallel library, snow library, multicore library.

Question 2
Pick one of the parallelization libraries and give it a try in this excerise by only using 4 cores.

Answer:
example by using parallel library:
func <- function(x) {
    n = 1
    raw <- x
    while (x > 1) {
        x <- ifelse(x%%2==0,x/2,3*x+1)
        n = n + 1
    }
    return(c(raw,n))
}
 
library(parallel)

system.time({
    x <- 1:Markets1
    cl <- makeCluster(4)  
    results <- parLapply(cl,x,func) 
    res.df <- do.call('rbind',results)
    stopCluster(cl) 
})
